- Academic lectures tend to be better than youtubers.
    - Lecturers tend to be better experts than youtubers.
    - The majority of youtubers are students or enthusiasts. Most lecturers are professors.
    - Lectures are covering a broader area.
        - Videos made for youtube focus on one tidbit, without broader context. 
    - Lectures are more boring
- I see that as a benefit.I try to avoid strong stimuli and improve my patience.
- GreatCourses are good for relaxation.
    - I often want to just watch something easy while eating or relaxing.
    - academic lectures are too boring for this purpose for me.
    - But lectures on GreatCourses are shorter and more fun.
    - they also have about 25m, which is ideal for a break for lunch or traveling to work. 
    - their disadvantage compared to academic lectures:
        - less advanced and technical treatment.
   - I like to watch lectures on GreatCourses while cooking, cleaning dishes, and doing similar house-chores.
- I assume that I will forget most of what I am watching. Therefore, I am not counting this as a "real education".
    - but it is relaxing
    - and it is the best use of time when I am eating, traveling, etc. I have.
    - and it is satisfying my curiosity, which is a very strong drive.
- alternatives:
    - podcasts
    - audiobooks
    - non-educational videos.
