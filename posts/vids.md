- Academic lectures tend to be better than youtubers.
	- Lecturers tend to be better experts than youtubers.
		- most youtubers are students or enthusiasts. Most lecturers are professors.
	- Lectures are covering broader area.
		- Videos made for youtube focus on one tidbit, without broader context. 
	- Lectures are more boring
		- I take that as an advantage. I try to avoid strong stimuli and improve my patience.
- GreatCourses are good for relaxation.
	- I often want to just watch something easy while eating or relaxing.
	- academic lectures are too boring for this purpose for me.
	- But lectures on GreatCourses are shorter and more fun.
	- they also have about 25m, which is ideal for a break for lunch or traveling to work. 
	- their disadvantage compared to academic lectures:
		- less advanced and technical treatment.
- I assume that I will forget most of what I am watching. Therefore I am not counting this as a "real education".
	- but it is relaxing
	- and it is the best use of time when I am eating or traveling etc. I have.
	- and it is satysfying my curiosity, which is a very strong drive.
